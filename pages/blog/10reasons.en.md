### 1. Reach a broader audience

Not everyone has a big amount of money to spend, small-time investors may be interested in your project, what keeps them from buying is the high gas fee they have to pay for the trade, making the investment not worth it for them. If you list your token on WanSwap the transaction cost will be less than 0.01$. Equity, this is what Crypto is all about! Why wait for L2 solutions when the solution is already there.

### 2. Listing is free

WanSwap does not require a listing fee, the only thing you need to do is provide the initial liquidity for the trading pair.

### 3. It’s Cross-Chain

Your tokens can be traded on several chains. If an investor does not hold ETH, they can trade 
for wanEOS, wanBTC, or WAN. More chains will be added soon. The tech is provided by Wanchain.
